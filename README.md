# Boom or Bust

A simple game that involves a lot of randomized numbers and a little bit of luck.

# How to Play

Each game starts with the user being given a random goal total (between 20-119). Four buttons, represented by images of poker chips, are each given random values between 1-12. By clicking on these buttons, the player can add to their own total to try and match the goal

If the player matches the goal without going over, then they win. If they go over, then they lose. There are no other possibilities in this game.
